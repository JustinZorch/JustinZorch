### Hi there, I'm Justin Louckx ðŸ‘‹

I studied BSC Mechanical Engineering and worked as a Derivatives trader from 2012-2019. I am transitioning into Software Engineering with a primary focus on backend. I am self studying via Udemy and Youtube. Iâ€™m very excited for Web3 and DeFi in particular and learning Solidity.
